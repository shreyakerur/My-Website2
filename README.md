# My-Website2

Hello there!
This is a **Responsive Portfolio Website**
I am impressed by the overall response of the website however
even if the website was running properly in my text editor, after uploading and hosting on GitHub,
I have observed an error in the UI/UX which makes the text look like the basic version of HTML.
Hence, I think I should rectify the error using Version Control itself or
Do let me know if there are other ways to rectify this.
Thank you!
